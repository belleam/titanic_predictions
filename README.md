## Predicting survivors of the Titanic with machine learning

Of the 2240 people on board the Titanic, an estimated 1503 died (according to a British investigation). It seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.

Using passenger data, these logistic regression models predict which passengers were more likely to survive based on key details such as age, sex, and class.

The datasets were provided as part of a [Kaggle compeitition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/overview).
